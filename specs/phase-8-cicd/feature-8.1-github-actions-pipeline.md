# Feature 8.1: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED** | **Completed Date: 2025-06-26** | **Commit: HEAD** | **Assignee: Claude** | **Git Tag: feature-8.1-completed**

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, packaging, and releasing the TTS Chrome Extension. This feature will ensure code quality, security, and streamline the deployment process.

## Requirements

### Core CI Pipeline
- [x] Automated builds on every push and PR
- [x] TypeScript compilation and type checking
- [x] Jest test execution with coverage reports
- [x] ESLint and Prettier checks
- [x] Extension manifest validation
- [x] Node.js version matrix testing (18.x, 20.x)

### Extension Packaging
- [x] Automated .zip creation for distribution
- [x] Version management from package.json
- [x] Build artifact uploads
- [x] Development and production builds

### Release Automation
- [x] Semantic versioning based on commits
- [x] GitHub Releases creation
- [x] Changelog generation
- [x] Tagged releases with artifacts

### Security Features
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] ESLint security rules with SARIF
- [x] Permissions audit for manifest.json
- [x] License compliance checking

### Performance Monitoring
- [x] Bundle size tracking
- [x] Size limit enforcement
- [x] Performance metrics reporting
- [x] Build time optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Directory Structure
```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml           # Main CI pipeline
│   ├── release.yml      # Release automation
│   ├── security.yml     # Security scanning
│   └── performance.yml  # Bundle monitoring
└── dependabot.yml       # Dependency updates
```

### Workflow Triggers
- **CI Pipeline**: Push to any branch, PRs
- **Release**: Push to main with version tags
- **Security**: Daily schedule + PR checks
- **Performance**: PR checks + main branch

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_VERSION`: Matrix of Node.js versions
- `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`: For Web Store publishing (optional)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Built-in authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **CI Pipeline**
   - All tests pass on multiple Node.js versions
   - Code quality checks enforce standards
   - Build artifacts are accessible

2. **Packaging**
   - Extension .zip is properly formatted
   - Version numbers are consistent
   - All required files are included

3. **Security**
   - No high/critical vulnerabilities
   - ESLint security rules pass
   - Manifest permissions documented

4. **Performance**
   - Bundle size under 2MB limit
   - Build completes under 5 minutes
   - Metrics tracked over time

## Dependencies

- GitHub Actions runners
- Node.js 18+ environments
- npm package registry access
- GitHub permissions for releases

## Testing Plan

1. **Pipeline Testing**
   - Create test branches and PRs
   - Verify all checks run correctly
   - Test failure scenarios

2. **Release Testing**
   - Test version bumping
   - Verify artifact generation
   - Check changelog accuracy

3. **Security Testing**
   - Introduce known vulnerabilities
   - Test SARIF report generation
   - Verify security alerts

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices
- Use action versions with SHA pins
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Minimize workflow run times
- Use matrix builds efficiently

### Future Enhancements
- Chrome Web Store automated publishing
- Microsoft Edge Add-ons publishing
- Beta/canary release channels
- Performance regression detection

- Supports Feature 1.2 (Development Environment)
- Enhances Feature 5.3 (Error Handling)

## Estimated Effort

- **Setup**: 2-3 hours
- **Testing**: 1-2 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour
- **Total**: 4-6 hours
