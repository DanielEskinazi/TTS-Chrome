# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to implementing the UI redesign while maintaining extension stability and user experience.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### Goals
- Establish new design system
- Update build configuration
- Create base components

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Design System Setup
- [ ] Create `src/popup/styles/design-system.css` with CSS variables
- [ ] Update webpack config to include global styles
- [ ] Create typography utilities
- [ ] Test color contrast ratios

#### 1.2 Component Library Setup
- [ ] Create `src/popup/components/ui/` directory
- [ ] Build Button component with all variants
- [ ] Build StatusIndicator component
- [ ] Build Select component for voice dropdown

#### 1.3 Remove Legacy Code
- [ ] Archive existing popup.css
- [ ] Identify and remove unused components
- [ ] Clean up redundant event listeners

### Deliverables
- Design system implemented
- Base UI components ready
- Clean codebase for redesign

## Phase 2: Core Redesign (Week 2)

### Goals
- Implement new layout structure
- Replace existing controls with new components
- Achieve visual parity with design specs

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Layout Implementation
- [ ] Create new popup.html structure
- [ ] Implement flexbox layout system
- [ ] Set fixed width (320px)
- [ ] Remove scrollable areas

#### 2.2 Status Indicator
- [ ] Replace "TTS is not active" message
- [ ] Implement three states: Ready/Speaking/Paused
- [ ] Add pulse animation for speaking state
- [ ] Connect to background state management

#### 2.3 Primary Action Button
- [ ] Create unified Play/Pause button
- [ ] Implement state-based text/icon changes
- [ ] Add proper click handlers
- [ ] Ensure proper state synchronization

#### 2.4 Control Simplification
- [ ] Remove speed slider, keep only presets
- [ ] Convert volume to preset buttons + mute
- [ ] Remove "Force Stop" from main view
- [ ] Hide blue button or clarify its purpose

### Deliverables
- New UI fully implemented
- All core features functional
- Compact, no-scroll layout

## Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Week 3)

### Goals
- Add micro-interactions
- Implement advanced settings
- Optimize performance

### Tasks

#### 3.1 Micro-interactions
- [ ] Add button press animations
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Create error state displays

#### 3.2 Advanced Settings
- [ ] Create settings panel/page
- [ ] Move advanced features (Force Stop, etc.)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts reference
- [ ] Implement domain-specific settings UI

#### 3.3 Accessibility
- [ ] Add ARIA labels
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Implement high contrast mode support

#### 3.4 Performance
- [ ] Optimize React re-renders
- [ ] Reduce popup open time
- [ ] Minimize background messages
- [ ] Add performance metrics

### Deliverables
- Polished, professional interface
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible to all users

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 4)

### Goals
- Comprehensive testing
- User feedback integration
- Final polish

### Tasks

#### 4.1 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new components
- [ ] Integration tests for state management
- [ ] Manual testing across Chrome versions
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows/Mac/Linux)

#### 4.2 User Testing
- [ ] Internal team testing
- [ ] Beta user feedback collection
- [ ] A/B testing if applicable
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback

#### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new UI
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Document component API
- [ ] Update screenshots

### Deliverables
- Fully tested extension
- Documentation updated
- Ready for release

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Centralize UI state in popup controller
- Minimize background script communication
- Cache voice list for performance

### Build Process
- Update webpack for CSS modules
- Consider CSS-in-JS for components
- Optimize bundle size

### Backwards Compatibility
- Migrate user settings
- Preserve keyboard shortcuts
- Maintain API compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **User Resistance**: Dramatic UI change
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, clear communication
   
2. **Performance Regression**: New animations
   - Mitigation: Performance budget, testing
   
3. **Accessibility Issues**: New components
   - Mitigation: Early accessibility testing

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Popup open time < 100ms
- Time to first TTS < 2 clicks
- Bundle size < 500KB

### Qualitative
- Professional appearance
- Intuitive interaction
- Positive user feedback

## Release Strategy

### Beta Release
1. Internal testing (1 week)
2. Limited beta (100 users, 1 week)
3. Gradual rollout (10%, 50%, 100%)

### Communication
- Update extension description
- Create "What's New" popup
- Blog post about redesign

## Timeline Summary

- **Week 1**: Foundation setup
- **Week 2**: Core implementation  
- **Week 3**: Polish and features
- **Week 4**: Testing and release

Total: 4 weeks from start to production release
